        <h2>ABOUT BTS</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>BTS</strong> (Korean: ë°©íƒ„ì†Œë…„ë‹¨; RR:
          <em> Bangtan Sonyeondan</em>), is a Grammy-nominated South Korean
          group that has been capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally
          since its debut in June 2013. The members of BTS are
          <span class="member-names">
            Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook
          </span>
          â€”co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip
          hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of
          genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary,
          touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and
          coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and
          individualism. Their work also often references literature and
          psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
